  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>Is this company really built by cats?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, see our
    <a href="/about/#team">team members</a>
    above! And below is our office in Meowtain View!

  <h3>I don't believe you, you can't type with your paws!</h3>
  <p>
    Actually we have our own programming language, called PawScript. We use that
    with our special keyboard. We also built our own compiler called PawSweet
    which compiles PawScript to Svelte, which is the human-friendly javascript
    compiler. We suggest that you try it too, it's really cool!

  <h3>I see, so how do I use your product?</h3>
  <p>
    We charge by
    <span class="fish-treats">
      <img src="/assets/images/fish.svg" alt="fish treats" />
    </span>
    , but you can pay by stripe in US Dollars. It will translate to our fish
    treats currency.
